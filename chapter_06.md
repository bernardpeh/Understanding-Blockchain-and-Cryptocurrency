# Security and Warnings

Security is the most important thing in cryptocurrency. Try to use a **hardware wallet** for storing your cryptocurrencies. Be paranoid.

## Checklist for Creating Online Accounts

Storing crypto online is dangerous but sometimes necessary. Today, many people have different accounts on different exchanges. You still need to use centralised exchanges in order to withdraw fiat currency.

* Use reputable exchanges.

* Use strong passwords. A complex combination of characters doesn’t mean it’s a good password. Eg, P@sswords123 is still a poor password. Ensure 2FA enabled. Save all the 2FA seeds in case you lose your mobile phone. 

* Monitor CPU usage. Use extensions like no coin to block browser mining.

* Check domain name when accessing the site. For example, you could easily missed etherdelta as etherde1ta.com if not careful.

* All logins must be SSL enabled. Check SSL is issued for the right domain. Do not log into websites using self-signed certificates. 

* Keep your computer OS updated and Virus free.

## Checklist when Sending Funds

* When not using QR Code, always check the recipient address is pasted correctly. Make sure you are sending to an address of the same chain, ie BTC to BTC etc, BCH to BCH. Some addresses doesn’t have checks, sending crypto to the wrong address will result in irrecoverable lost.

* Unfortunately, all transactions are irreversible and you cannot cancel it even if they stay pending in the mempool for a long time. The only way for a pending transaction to be reversed is if its being dropped out from the mempool. 

* Breaking large amounts of crypto into a few transactions is a good idea if you want to be safe. The downside is the need to pay more transaction fees.

* Always make sure that you are purchasing hardware wallets from official reseller by checking with the official website.

* An ICO can look really legitimate with proper linkedin profile for all team members and good looking whitepaper but still fake.
